I learned several things about GitHub, such as setting up a project board and assigning issues to collaborators, creating branches and merging them via pull requests.
With that being said, I still find GitHub to be unfamiliar territory, I’m not sure how to go about coding in GitHub yet 
but hopefully that would change very soon as we embark in this course’s project.
One of the interesting concepts in GitHub for me is how branches are duplicates of the main code so that to avoid mistakes in the core branch code.
If I had more time for this lab, I’ll research a bit more on coding in GitHub through accessible tools online, especially in YouTube, 
and attempt to create a functioning GreenCampus tool with its “green star” award system to encourage the youth to make eco-friendly decisions.
